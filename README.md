After creating the Boolean property IsPoliticallyExposed in the Itrade interface I updated the contract signature in the Trade class that inherits the Itrade interface and later I made the mapping in the methods of the classes that are in the Domain, Application and Presentation layers for the client's data input. Note: I mocked the variable with the value false because I needed more information about how the user input would be for this new category.
